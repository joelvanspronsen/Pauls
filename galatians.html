            <h1> Galations</h1>
            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>  Written to the church in Galatia
                Written by Paul in 49 AD
                Possibly paul's first letter
                Written to deal with problems of circumcision and Jewish legalism toward Gentile believers
                
                </p>

               <h2>Sumary</h2>
               <p>In chapters 1-2, Paul’s gives his testimony about how he had received the authentic Gospel message. He warns that if anyone presents another Gospel message other than the one he was preaching, that person is. Paul was speaking of the one true Gospel that he had received.
                Chapters 3-5:12, Paul begins by declaring that salvation is through faith and trust in Jesus Christ “Alone”, and cannot be obtained through the keeping of the Law. The Law (10 Commandments) is our tutor to lead us to salvation in Jesus Christ. No one can obey the 10 Commandments. It is impossible. Every person has broken them; therefore, we can only attain salvation through trusting in our Savior Christ Jesus.
                 Chapters 5:13-6, He teaches the Fruits of the Spirit and tells us to “walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh” (5:16). Good works does not save, but a Christian must have the desire to produce good fruit, obey God’s Law and live a holy and righteous life in the eyes of God. Christians should live this redeemed life.</p>
