            <h1> Romans</h1>
            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p> It was written to the Church in Rome.
                Romans is a letter Paul had sent to the Christians in Rome.
                This book was written about A.D. 57. Paul wrote it from the city of Corinth.
                He wrote it the Romans to help them in their faith and to live for and serve God.
                It was written to show how Jesus’ death makes us right with God and how Jesus will help us live a good life.

               <h2>Sumary</h2>
               <p>In Romans chapters 1-8, Paul speaks of the sinful nature of all men in the eyes of God, righteousness, justification by faith in Jesus Christ, freedom from sin, and victory in Christ.
                In chapters 9-11, Paul explains God’s sovereignty over salvation through faith in Christ. (Patricia)
                Chapters 12-16, Paul is giving instructions to all Christians about how to live a holy life.(Patricia)
                Romans 12:1-2 he writes: “Present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice”, and “Do not be conformed to this world”. 
                These verses are a good reminder to not get caught up in all the materials of the world. We have to remember that it is temporary.We need to live before God. 
                In Romans 1:16–17: The Just Live by Faith “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.  For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.”         
                This is a pretty powerful verse, Paul is very bold in faith when he says this, this a good example to us and I should push us to stand up for our faith. 
                In Romans 3:9-10 it says “What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made charge that the Jews and Gentiles alike under the power of sin. As it is written: There is no one righteous not even one.”
                This verse really puts us in our place. It really is a good reminder that we are all sinners and we have no excuse. I find it very humbling 
                In Romans 4:1-25 it talks about Abraham justified by faith. His faith was credited by righteousness. In Romans 4:7,8 says: “Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.” He put his faith in the Lord. 
                In Romans 5:1-11 it talks about having peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Paul convinces us that the way to salvation is to be justified by grace through faith 
                In Romans 12:9-21 it tells us about love. To overcome evil with good.
