            <h1> Thessalonians 2</h1>
            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p> The book of 2nd Thessalonians is a letter from Paul. The Apostle Paul wrote it about 52-54 A.D., several months after his first letter to the church in Thessalonica. The key people in this book are the Apostle Paul, Silas, and Timothy. Paul wrote this letter to reemphasize the coming return of Jesus Christ. Some of the people in Thessalonica had thought that Jesus had already returned, this letter was written to correct any misunderstandings. Paul needed to fix 3 major problems the church in Thessalonica faced: 1st Persecution from the Outside, 2nd Despair from False Doctrine and 3rd Busybodies in the Church.

               <h2>Sumary</h2>
               <p>Persecution from the outside: Paul puts the church’s situation in context. The’re being identified with Jesus and therefore Jesus hates them now. But what happens later, when Jesus returns? God will give them relief and judge their persecutors ( 2 Thessalonians 1:6-7). Jesus will be glorified, and so will His saints (2 Thessalonians 1:10-12). What happens when Jesus returns? Justice.
                Despair from false doctrine: Someone has told the church that Jesus had already returned and gathered His own to Him, possibly even forging a letter from Paul (2 Thessalonians 2:2). Paul reminds the church of his teachings regarding the return of Jesus, and the things that must happen beforehand, including the appearance of the mysterious “man of lawlessness” (2 thessalonians 2:3).
                
                Busybodies in the Church: A few Thessalonians had fallen off into undisciplined lives: Some had become “busybodies” people getting involved in other’s work without contributing themselves( 2 Thessalonians 3:11). Paul reminds them of the example he set: how he worked among them with his own hands ( 2 Thessalonians 3: 7-8). He also leaves instructions for dealing with those who would reject his teachings in this letter ( 2 thessalonians 3:14-15).
                </p>
               
                <h2>Important Teachings</h2>
                <p>God will punish the wicked ( 2 Thessalonians 1: 5-10)
                    Everyone should work ( 2 Thessalonians 3: 6-15) 
                    
                    
                     </p>
